-- Spec files have to be placed into the same directory as the test driver, or
-- into a subdirectory. The name of a spec file has to end in Spec.hs;
-- the module name has to match the file name.
-- Each spec file has to export a top-level binding spec of type Spec.

-- A complete example is at https://github.com/hspec/hspec-example.
